MAKESTUFF LX9 BOARD v1.0
------------------------

This is a small four-layer PCB incorporating:

   * A Xilinx Spartan-6 LX9 FPGA
   * A Cypress FX2LP Hi-Speed USB microcontroller
   * A 16MiB SDRAM, 16 bits wide
   * An SD-card slot
   * A well-grounded 80-way 2mm-pitch edge-connector with 47 FPGA I/Os
   * A second 2mm edge-connector with the FX2LP's port D and the SD card pins
   * A 1Mib EEPROM for the FX2LP firmware, FPGA design & initialisation data
   * FPGALink-compatibility

It is intended to be small enough and cheap enough to be used as a building-
block for larger FPGA-based projects, and to be solderable at home with the bare
minimum of tools (i.e no reflow oven, just a decent soldering iron). The
component cost for a small (e.g 20-off) run comes to about Â£27 for each board,
including the PCB.

The design files are in KiCad format (http://www.kicad-pcb.org). I used this:
